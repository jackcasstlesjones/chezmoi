Firefox and Thunderbird Wayland Fractional Scaling Fix
======================================================

Problem:
--------
Firefox and Thunderbird appear blurry when plugging in external monitors with
different DPI/scaling settings (e.g., 4K monitor with 1.33 scaling vs laptop
screen with 1.175 scaling).

Root Cause:
-----------
Mozilla apps have native Wayland fractional scaling support, but it's disabled
by default. Without it enabled, they don't properly handle dynamic scaling
changes when monitors are hotplugged or windows are moved between displays.

Solution:
---------
Enable native Wayland fractional scaling in about:config/Config Editor:

Firefox:
1. Open Firefox
2. Navigate to about:config
3. Search for: widget.wayland.fractional-scale.enabled
4. Set to: true

Thunderbird:
1. Open Thunderbird
2. Go to Settings → Config Editor (bottom of General settings)
3. Search for: widget.wayland.fractional-scale.enabled
4. Set to: true

Requirements:
-------------
- MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 must be set (already configured in hyprland.conf)
- Apps will restart with proper scaling support

Notes:
------
- This feature was added recently and is still being refined by Mozilla
- It's disabled by default for stability/compatibility reasons
- Once enabled, Firefox/Thunderbird will properly scale when moving between
  monitors with different DPI settings without needing restarts
- Bug 1849109 (context menu issues) was fixed in March 2025
