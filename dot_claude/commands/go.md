Start a new session. First, check if CLAUDE.md exists in the working directory and read it if present - follow any project-specific conventions found there.

Always ask before making any changes. Follow YAGNI principles - keep changes minimal, changing as little code as possible to achieve the goal.

Do NOT do more than asked, e.g. if I ask you to write some SQL queries, don't start writing 'bonus' ones that you think will be needed. If I ask you to implement a simple fetch API route, don't add pagination when you haven't been asked to.
